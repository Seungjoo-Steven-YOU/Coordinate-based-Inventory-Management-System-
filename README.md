# Coordinate-based Inventory Management System 
 A coordinate-based Inventory Management System to improve business processes.

The objective of this program is to be able to locate and update products in the inventory. Currently, the main issue is a lack of a procedural method that everybody can follow under pressure and during a work day, with as little staff as possible.To address this, we need to have a well established backend that maintains the same structure of each product and their location in an inventory with a functional and efficient front-end GUI application that both seasoned sales team members and new hires can utilize for fast item search and auditing.

# Background
This background will explain my thought process and ideas. ***It is unnecessary to read this section to understand the section, however I believe it contextualizes my program and will serve to remind myself how I made some of the choices that I have made. You may skip this section entirely if needed.***

As lead developer, I want to be able to utilize my unique skillset in computer programming, data manipulation, and logistical improvement to dramtically improve the system we have in place in our store. My first shipment day at the store made me realize that the system that we had in place left a lot to be desired. The management team had actually challenged me to develop a better system to improve the store processes, and I accepted. In the following section, I will illustrate both the programming and non-programming improvements that could be made in order to help our company cut losses in time and resources.

Before we do this however, I wanted to quickly mention some of the inspiration that allowed me to develop this system. You may think my duties as a military logistics officer was the primary motivator for this, however the challenges presented in this store are vastly different from the ones we faced on base. In the military, there were multiple warehouses that had been mapped out in advance by my commanding officers and their higher ups that made my job a lot easier. Furthermore, there were often changes in the material that were coming into the base, however there was never any new 'products' that were entering the store. In a retail setting, the entry of a new product means it has to first be sorted by predicted demand, category, and product name in an appropriate way that allows for fast item retrieval. This of course was never a challenge in the military, as there was varying degrees of demand for newer products (Like bedding, soaps, or cigarettes), but all old and new materials were stored in the same boxes and bins in a fixed manner in all warehouses. In a retail setting, there is a need to constantly update the placement items with each shipment.   

Believe it or not, a source of inspiration for this system comes from video games like Minecraft and my most recent studies in Linear Algebra. For those who are not aware, Minecraft is a popular sandbox videogame that is so intricate and powerful that you can actually build a functioning [8-bit computer in game](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/redstone-discussion-and/redstone-creations/3043582-8-bit-computer-turing-complete). ***(Sidenote: This means you can in theory simulate anything from a calculator to Microsoft Word to even Minecraft within a computer designed in a Minecraft server!)*** I was inspired by the coordinate system in the game (As far as I know, it's one of the only games that has this feature to this extent), which every randomly generated world in Minecraft has, which allows users to always return to an exact location without fail (As long as you are not killed by mobs in the process).

Another source of surprising inspiration was linear algebra, which is one of the most intellectually stimulating and beautiful branch of beginner/intermediate Mathematics that I have been exposed to. It should be unsurprising that the three-dimensional coordinate system is inspired by a simple directional vector with the same number of components. A more advanced concept I was inspired by were bijection and homomorphic linear mapping, which basically means that two spaces are 'equivalent' in a sense. As long as this system is designed in a correct way, I want the physical structure of the storage room to no longer matter, as the mapping of each product should be homomorphic to each space and should theoretically be able to map each unique product to each bin, no matter how many products there are and no matter the size or structure of storage.

One thing I should say early as a disclaimer is that one thing I should have took as 'inspiration', which I have not, is existing retail store practices and how they organize their products. For example, stores like Walmart, Amazon, Costco, and other major retailers have far greater space, products, and personnel dedicated to inventory. It may be useful to research the practices of these stores and view how these large retailers organize inventory and retrieve items. I assume that my coordinate system is somewhat similar to what is used by large scale retailers, in which case consider my application to be a comparatively smaller scale implementation of this that fits the organizational needs of a sales team for small to medium sized retailers. Whether or not this exact system is utilized by big retail, I know one thing for sure: *every major retailer **HAS** to have some algorithmic inventory management system, as it would quickly become impossible to manage inventory as the number of products in store increases.*

============================================================================================
# What does the application do?
Here's a simplified problem that the reader can use to understand this program. Suppose you are a retail manager with 100 different products in-store that can be grouped into 4 equally sized categories of size 25. Now let's say that 40 products are coming into the store that are grouped into 4 equally sized categories of size 10. For now, suppose all products are new, meaning all 40 products have never been in the store previously. Also suppose that there are broadly two main operating rooms: The front room for customers and the back room for additional storage. How would you like to organize the inventory in the front and back in a way that complies with your business needs?

At the present, our store manages items by popularity of items and alphabetical ordering. Most popular items go in the front, and less popular items go in the back; these subgroups are then alphabetically and categorically organized. However, an issue immediately emerges. Suppose there is an item called "abxxx" that has historically been placed between "aaxxx" and "acxxx". Suppose a new item comes in named "abaxx". The previous layout of the inventory would be [aaxxx, abxxx, acxxx], however the updated layout of the inventory would now be [aaxxx, abaxx, **abxxx, acxxx**]. Similar to an array in a computer, this 'insertion' of a new product during sorting actually leads to multiple additional operations. In essence, it is far more work to brute-force this and it is practically unfeasible to scale this to any extent.

However sorting is something computers that computers particularly excel at; a single computer can outperform any number of humans in these tasks. In essence, what the application does is apply multiple sorting algorithms (all taught in introductory computer programming courses (some of them even being online and free!)), and assigning a coordinate to each item. Of course, the devil is in the detail, and executing this seemingly 'simple' task is actually challenging. However, these are the guiding ideas that have allowed me to develop a relatively simple system which hopefully can improve our inventory process. Ultimately, both successful and unsuccessful retail stores have to have **some sort of** inventory system, however I believe the successful retail store has a **good** inventory system that is simple, yet effective.
